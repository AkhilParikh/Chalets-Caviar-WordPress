# Chalets-Caviar-WordPress
Created a WordPress site in which I added custom modifications to a default theme and incorporated "client" requests based on Project requirements for OpenClassrooms Project.

Project includes a detail step by step guide for non-technical users, to allow an easy handoff of site and ensure end-user personnel knows how to manage simply tasks from site.
